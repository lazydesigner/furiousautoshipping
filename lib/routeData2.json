      {
        "question": "How much does it cost to ship a car from Texas to Ohio?",
        "answer": "Costs typically range from $850 for a small sedan on an open carrier to over $2,000 for a large truck or enclosed transport. Rates vary based on seasonal demand, fuel prices, and specific pickup/delivery locations."

      {
        "question": "Can I put personal items in my car during transport?",

        "question": "Is Enclosed Transport necessary for Delaware to Hawaii?",
        "answer": "While not strictly required, it is highly recommended for the ground portion (DE to CA/WA) during winter months to avoid road salt and debris. The ocean portion is typically done in a RoRo (Roll-on/Roll-off) vessel, which is already enclosed."

      {
        "question": "Is my vehicle insured during transit?",
        "answer": "Yes, your vehicle is covered by the motor carrier's cargo insurance during the ground phase and by the ocean carrier's liability during the sea phase. We provide additional gap protection for total peace of mind."

      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost to ship a car from New York to Mississippi?",
        "answer": "Costs generally range from $850 for a sedan on an open carrier to over $2,000 for a large truck or luxury vehicle in an enclosed trailer. Prices fluctuate based on seasonal demand and fuel costs."

      {
        "question": "Is Enclosed Transport necessary for New York to Mississippi?",
        "answer": "While not strictly necessary for most vehicles, it is highly recommended if you are moving during the winter to avoid road salt or if you own a high-value vehicle that you want to protect from debris on the 1,100-mile trip."

      {
        "question": "Will my car go through the George Washington Bridge?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Can I put personal items in the car?",
        "answer": "Most carriers allow up to 100 pounds of personal items in the trunk, but these items are not insured by the carrier's cargo insurance. It is best to keep the car empty to avoid weight issues with DOT scales."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my vehicle insured during transit?",
        "answer": "Yes, all our carriers must provide a valid certificate of insurance. Your vehicle is covered against carrier negligence and equipment failure from the moment of pickup until delivery."

        "question": "How much does it cost to ship a car from Florida to Massachusetts?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost to ship a car from Florida to Ohio?",
        "answer": "Costs vary wildly by season. In the spring (peak season), a sedan might cost between $900 and $1,200. In the winter (off-peak for northbound), that same trip could cost $600 to $800. We recommend getting a quote 2-3 weeks in advance."

      {
        "question": "Is Enclosed Transport necessary for Florida to Ohio?",
        "answer": "For most daily drivers, Open Transport is fine. However, if you are shipping a classic car or a high-end luxury vehicle, Enclosed Transport is better. It protects the car from road debris and spring hail storms that often occur in Kentucky and Ohio."

      {
        "question": "Can I pack personal items in my car?",
        "answer": "You can usually pack up to 100 lbs of personal items in the trunk. However, the driver's seat and front passenger seat must remain empty. Also, never pack electronics, valuables, or medications, as carrier insurance does not cover personal goods."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to be present for pickup?",
        "answer": "Yes, you or a designated agent must be there. You need to sign the Bill of Lading and inspect the vehicle with the driver. If you are already in Ohio, a neighbor or family member in Florida can handle the handover for you."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my vehicle insured during transit?",

        "question": "How long does shipping a car from Texas to Colorado take?",
        "answer": "Typically, transit time is between 2 to 4 days. The distance is relatively short, often under 1,000 miles, which allows drivers to complete the trip quickly. However, weather in the Panhandle or Rockies can cause minor delays."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost to ship a car from Texas to Colorado?",
        "answer": "Costs generally range from $650 to $1,100 for a standard sedan on an open carrier. This price varies based on fuel prices, the specific size of your vehicle, and the season. Summer rates are higher due to demand."

        "answer": "You can typically pack up to 100 lbs of personal items in the trunk or cargo area. These items must be secured and below the window line. However, the driver is not liable for these goods, and they are not covered by the carrier's insurance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to be present for pickup and delivery?",
        "answer": "Yes, or you must designate a trusted representative. Someone must be there to sign the Bill of Lading and verify the vehicle's condition at both the origin in Texas and the destination in Colorado."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my vehicle insured during transit?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost to ship a car from Texas to California?",
        "answer": "Costs generally range from $850 to $1,400 for a standard sedan on an open carrier. This price fluctuates based on fuel prices along I-10 and the specific season. Summer moves are usually slightly more expensive due to higher demand."

        "question": "Is Enclosed Transport necessary for Texas to California?",

        "question": "Can I put personal items in the car?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Are there tolls on the route from Texas to California?",
        "answer": "The primary routes, I-10 and I-40, are largely toll-free. This helps keep carrier costs down compared to East Coast routes. However, carriers factor in higher fuel consumption due to the mountainous terrain in parts of New Mexico and California."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my vehicle insured during transit?",

        "answer": "Typically, transit time is 3 to 5 days. This depends on the specific route the driver takes. Some drivers cut through Nevada, while others use the I-5 corridor through California. Weather in the mountain passes can also cause slight delays."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost to ship a car from Arizona to Oregon?",
        "answer": "Costs generally range from $950 to $1,400 for a standard sedan. However, prices peak in April and May when snowbirds return north. Shipping in the winter or late summer is usually cheaper."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Enclosed Transport necessary for Arizona to Oregon?",
        "answer": "For most daily drivers, Open Transport is fine. However, if you are shipping a classic car or a luxury vehicle, we recommend Enclosed Transport. It protects the vehicle from desert sand in Arizona and rain or road debris in Oregon."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the carrier route through California or Nevada?",
        "answer": "Most large car carriers prefer the I-5 route through California because it is a major freight lane. However, some smaller carriers may take US-93 through Nevada. Both routes are safe, but I-5 is more common for standard auto transport."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I leave personal items in my car?",
        "answer": "You can usually leave up to 100 lbs of personal items in the trunk or cargo area. However, these items must be secured and below the window line. The driver is not insured for household goods, so do not pack electronics or valuables."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my vehicle insured during transit?",
        "answer": "Yes, all our carriers must maintain active cargo insurance. Your vehicle is covered from the moment of pickup until delivery. We verify every carrier's insurance certificate before dispatching your order."

      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost to ship a car from Arizona to Illinois?",
        "answer": "Costs vary based on the season. In the spring (peak season), a sedan on an open carrier might cost between $1,000 and $1,300. In the winter, rates often drop because demand for northbound transport is lower."

        "question": "Is Enclosed Transport necessary for Arizona to Illinois?",

      {
        "question": "Does the carrier drive straight through?",
        "answer": "Yes, usually the same truck that picks up your car will deliver it. We rarely use terminals unless you specifically request it. This method, called door-to-door shipping, is faster and safer for your vehicle."
