        "answer": "Transit time averages 4-6 days for this 1,280-mile journey. Weather affects timing—winter storms in Virginia or Maryland can add 1-2 days. Summer offers the fastest service at 4 days average. Peak season demand (March-May northbound) sometimes extends delivery to 6 days. We provide GPS tracking so you monitor your car's progress up I-95 in real-time."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I pack personal items in my car?",
        "answer": "Yes, but only in the trunk. Industry standard allows up to 100 lbs of personal items. Items must fit below the window line so they're not visible. Carriers are not licensed to transport household goods, so you pack at your own risk. Do not pack valuables, firearms, or hazardous materials. Our insurance covers the vehicle only, not personal belongings inside."

        "question": "How much does it cost to ship a car from Miami to New York?",

Peak season (March-May) increases rates by 15-25%. Winter off-peak season (December-February) offers the lowest prices. Get an exact quote based on your specific vehicle and dates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will the driver deliver to my apartment building in Manhattan?",
        "answer": "No. Manhattan below 60th Street bans 18-wheelers on most streets. We deliver to accessible terminals in Long Island City (Queens), the South Bronx, or Secaucus, NJ. You drive or Uber to pick up your car. Brooklyn and some Queens neighborhoods also require terminal meets due to narrow residential streets. This protects your car from tight-space damage."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if a hurricane threatens Miami during my pickup window?",
        "answer": "We monitor all weather closely. If a hurricane threatens South Florida, we contact you immediately to reschedule. Safety comes first. Most carriers evacuate the Miami area 48-72 hours before hurricane landfall. We'll pick up your car after the storm passes and roads reopen. No cancellation fees apply for hurricane delays—it's beyond everyone's control."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to be present for pickup and delivery?",
        "answer": "Yes, or an authorized adult over 18. Someone must be present to sign the Bill of Lading and hand over keys. This protects both you and the carrier. The person inspects the car with the driver and notes any existing damage on the condition report. At delivery in New York, you or your representative inspects the car again before signing off."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you ship my car if it doesn't run?",
        "answer": "Yes, but inoperable vehicles cost $150-$200 more. Carriers need a working winch to load non-running cars onto the trailer. The vehicle must roll and steer. If the battery is dead, that's fine. If the transmission is locked or wheels don't turn, special equipment is needed. Always disclose if your car doesn't run when requesting a quote."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I prepare my car for shipping?",
        "answer": "Remove all personal items except up to 100 lbs in the trunk. Disable your car alarm to prevent it from draining the battery. Leave only a quarter tank of gas—full tanks add weight and cost. Remove toll transponders (E-ZPass, SunPass) to avoid charges. Take photos of your car from all angles before pickup. Ensure your car has no leaks and the battery holds a charge."

        "question": "How long does it take to ship from Fort Lauderdale to New York City?",
        "answer": "Transit time runs 4-6 days for the 1,280-mile journey. Pickup happens within 1-3 days of booking during normal seasons. The actual drive takes 19-22 hours but drivers must rest per DOT rules. Spring northbound season adds 1-2 days due to high demand. Winter ice storms near Richmond or DC can delay delivery by a day. Summer offers the fastest transit with clear roads and long daylight hours."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I pack personal items in my car?",
        "answer": "Yes, but it's risky. Most carriers allow up to 100 pounds in the trunk only. Nothing on seats or visible through windows. Items must not exceed the roofline. Insurance does not cover personal belongings - only the vehicle. If items shift and damage your car during transport, you're liable. We recommend shipping important items separately via UPS or bringing them in your luggage."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost to ship from Fort Lauderdale to NYC?",
        "answer": "Open transport runs $600-750 for sedans and small SUVs. Large trucks cost $750-850. Enclosed trailers add $300-400 for total costs of $950-1,150. Spring northbound season (April-May) adds 15-20% to base prices due to snowbird demand. Manhattan terminal delivery adds no extra fees. Door-to-door in outer boroughs may add $50-100 for tight street navigation. Get an exact quote based on your vehicle and dates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you deliver directly to Manhattan addresses?",
        "answer": "No, not below 60th Street. NYC bans commercial trucks in most of Manhattan. We deliver to secure terminal lots in Secaucus, NJ or Long Island City, Queens. You drive 15-20 minutes to pick up your car. This is industry standard - any company promising Manhattan door-to-door delivery is likely using a small truck and charging premium fees. Our terminal delivery is free and convenient."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the best time of year to ship this route?",
        "answer": "Summer (June-August) offers fast transit and moderate prices. Fall (September-November) has balanced traffic and fair rates. Avoid spring (April-May) when snowbirds return north - prices spike 20% and booking takes 2-3 weeks. Winter works if you dodge ice storms but southbound traffic to Florida drives up northbound costs. Book summer or fall for best value and speed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my car insured during transport?",
        "answer": "Yes. All licensed carriers must carry cargo insurance covering your vehicle in transit. Our carriers provide $100,000-250,000 minimum coverage per load. Insurance covers collision damage, not personal items inside. You'll receive the carrier's insurance certificate before pickup showing active coverage. Document existing scratches with photos before the driver loads your car. Review the condition report together at pickup and delivery."

        "question": "How long does it take to ship from Boca Raton to Long Island?",
        "answer": "The trip takes 4-6 days under normal conditions. Your car travels 1,280 miles up I-95 through eight states. Spring and summer offer faster transit with good weather. Winter can add 1-2 days if ice storms hit Virginia or Maryland. Peak season (March-April) may extend pickup times by a few days due to high demand. We'll give you a pickup window and keep you updated during transport."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I pack personal items in my car?",
        "answer": "Yes, but with strict limits. You can pack up to 100 pounds in the trunk only. Nothing on seats or dashboards. Insurance doesn't cover personal items, so pack at your own risk. Don't put valuables, cash, or important documents in the car. Most drivers are fine with a trunk full of clothes or linens. Anything over 100 pounds can cause DOT weight violations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost to ship from Boca Raton to Long Island?",
        "answer": "Open transport runs $750-$950 for a standard sedan. Small SUVs cost $800-$900. Large trucks or vans run $900-$1,050. Enclosed transport adds 40-60% to these prices. Spring (March-May) is most expensive due to Snowbird demand. Winter offers the best deals. Your exact Long Island location matters too. Hamptons delivery costs more than Levittown due to access challenges."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is door-to-door service available on Long Island?",
        "answer": "It depends on your street. Most suburban Nassau and Suffolk towns allow full door-to-door service. Tight village streets or beach communities may require a terminal meet nearby. The driver will scout your address and call ahead. If the truck can't fit, we'll arrange to meet you at a shopping center or parking lot within a few miles. This avoids residential access fees and keeps your price lower."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if there's a hurricane during my shipment?",
        "answer": "We monitor weather closely during hurricane season (June-November). If a storm threatens the I-95 corridor, we'll reroute carriers inland through I-77 or I-81. This may add 1-2 days to transit but keeps your car safe. We'll notify you immediately of any weather delays. In extreme cases, we may delay pickup until the storm passes. Your car's safety is our top priority."

        "answer": "Typical transit time is 4-6 days for the 1,290-mile journey. Your car leaves Tampa on I-75 North and arrives via I-93 or I-90 into Boston. Summer shipments run faster (4-5 days) because of good weather and driver availability. Winter adds 1-2 days because of weather delays through Virginia and the Mid-Atlantic. Spring and fall are middle ground at 5 days average. We give you a pickup window (usually 1-5 days) and a delivery window once your car is loaded. Track your shipment in real-time through our system."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I pack personal items in my car?",
        "answer": "Yes, but with limits. You can put up to 100 pounds of personal items in the trunk only. Nothing on the seats or dashboard. Insurance doesn't cover personal items, so you ship them at your own risk. Don't pack valuables, electronics, or fragile items. Carriers inspect cars before loading and will refuse overloaded vehicles. Pack smart: clothes, linens, and non-fragile items work fine. Heavy items can damage your suspension during transport."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost?",
        "answer": "Open transport from Tampa to Boston runs $700-$850 for a standard sedan. Small SUVs cost $750-$850. Large trucks or lifted vehicles run $850-$950. Enclosed transport adds $400-$600 to these prices. Winter and spring see 15-25% higher prices because of snowbird demand. Gated community pickups may add $50-$75. Final price depends on your exact vehicle, pickup location, delivery location, and time of year. Get a free quote for your specific situation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is door-to-door service available in both cities?",
        "answer": "Tampa door-to-door works great in suburbs like Brandon, Carrollwood, and New Tampa. Downtown Tampa and historic areas require terminal meets. Boston is trickier because of narrow streets. Beacon Hill, North End, and Back Bay need terminal delivery at nearby lots. South Boston, Dorchester, and outlying areas can do door-to-door depending on your exact street. We assess your addresses during booking and tell you exactly what's possible."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about insurance coverage?",
        "answer": "All carriers have cargo insurance covering your vehicle during transport. Basic coverage is included in your price and covers major damage. You can buy additional coverage for high-value or luxury vehicles. Your personal auto insurance stays active during transport. Document your car's condition with photos before pickup. Our drivers do the same. Any damage is reported immediately and claims are filed within 24 hours."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to be present for pickup and delivery?",
        "answer": "Yes, you or someone you authorize must be present at both ends. At pickup, you'll sign the Bill of Lading and do a vehicle inspection with the driver. At delivery, you'll inspect the car again and sign off. Your representative needs to be 18+ with valid ID. If you can't be there, give us the contact info for your representative. They'll need to do the same inspection and signing process."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you ship my car if it doesn't run?",
        "answer": "Yes, but it costs more. Non-running vehicles require special equipment (winches) to load and unload. This adds $150-$200 to your quote. Your car needs to roll, steer, and brake even if the engine doesn't start. Totally immobile vehicles need flatbed transport, which costs significantly more. Tell us during booking if your car doesn't run so we can arrange the right equipment."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if there's a hurricane in Florida during my pickup window?",
        "answer": "We monitor weather constantly. If a hurricane threatens Tampa during your pickup window, we'll contact you immediately. Options include: moving your pickup date earlier, delaying until after the storm, or switching to a terminal location away from the danger zone. Your safety and your car's safety come first. We don't charge cancellation fees for weather emergencies. Florida hurricane season (June-November) requires flexibility."

        "answer": "Transit time ranges from 4-6 days depending on season and weather. The 1,340-mile route uses I-75 and I-95. Spring and fall peak seasons may extend to 7-8 days due to high demand. Winter ice storms in Virginia can add 1-2 days. Summer offers the fastest service with minimal delays."

      {
        "question": "Can I pack personal items in my car?",
        "answer": "Yes, but keep it under 100 pounds in the trunk only. Items must not be visible through windows. We are not liable for personal belongings. Do not pack valuables, firearms, or perishables. Insurance covers the vehicle only, not contents."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost?",
        "answer": "Open transport for a sedan costs $750-$850. Enclosed transport runs $1,350-$1,550. SUVs and trucks cost $50-100 more. Peak season (April and October) adds 15-20%. Greenwich residential delivery fees add $150-200 if you want door-to-door service on narrow streets."

You drive your car home the final mile. Door-to-door is possible with a smaller truck for an extra $150-200 fee."

      {
        "question": "What about gated communities in Naples?",
        "answer": "Provide gate codes, guard contact info, and community name at booking. We call you when the driver is 2 hours away. Most pickups happen at the gatehouse or community clubhouse. Large carriers cannot navigate tight streets in Port Royal or Aqualane Shores."

      {
        "question": "Is my car insured during transport?",
        "answer": "Yes. All carriers have $1 million cargo insurance. This covers damage during loading, transit, and unloading. You must inspect your car at delivery and note any damage on the Bill of Lading immediately. Take photos before pickup as proof of condition."

      {
        "question": "How long does it take to ship from Fort Myers to Chicago?",
        "answer": "Transit time is typically 3-5 days for this 1,350-mile route. Your car isn't driving non-stop - drivers follow federal hours-of-service regulations requiring rest breaks. Pickup happens within 1-3 days of booking during normal season. Add 1-2 extra days during peak snowbird months (October-November southbound, April-May northbound). Winter weather near Chicago can add unexpected delays. We provide GPS tracking so you know exactly where your car is during transport."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I pack personal items in my car?",
        "answer": "Yes, but with strict limits. You can pack up to 100 pounds in the trunk only. Nothing on seats, dashboard, or visible through windows. Insurance doesn't cover personal items - pack at your own risk. Carriers inspect and may refuse overloaded vehicles. Don't pack valuables, firearms, or perishables. Moving boxes work better for household items. This rule applies industry-wide due to weight regulations and liability concerns."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost to ship from Fort Myers to Chicago?",
        "answer": "Open transport averages $625-$775 depending on vehicle size and season. Enclosed transport runs $950-$1,200 for weather protection. Prices jump 20-30% during peak snowbird season (October-November and April-May). Chicago downtown delivery adds $75-150 versus suburban terminal pickup. Larger trucks and SUVs cost more due to carrier weight limits. Get an exact quote based on your specific dates and vehicle type. Prices include full insurance coverage during transit."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the best time of year to ship this route?",
        "answer": "Summer (June-August) offers the best combination of low prices and fast transit times. Weather is clear and demand drops after snowbird season ends. Avoid October-November (southbound rush) and April-May (northbound rush) if you want cheaper rates. Winter shipments face delays from ice and snow near Chicago. Spring and fall have moderate pricing but require 2-3 weeks advance booking. Holiday weeks (Thanksgiving, Christmas) see price spikes and limited availability."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you deliver to downtown Chicago or just suburbs?",
        "answer": "We deliver throughout the Chicago metro area but downtown Loop requires special arrangements. Large car carriers cannot navigate narrow city streets or residential zones with permit restrictions. Downtown customers meet drivers at nearby suburban terminals in Cicero, Berwyn, or Des Plaines. Suburban addresses (Naperville, Aurora, Schaumburg) get direct door-to-door delivery. We confirm exact pickup/delivery logistics when you book. No extra fee for terminal meetings - it's included in your quote."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my car insured during transport?",
        "answer": "Yes. All licensed carriers must carry $1,000,000 cargo insurance minimum. This covers damage during loading, transit, and unloading. You receive the carrier's insurance certificate before pickup. Document your car's condition with photos before shipping. Inspect carefully at delivery and note any damage on the Bill of Lading immediately. File claims within 48 hours. Our team helps you through the claims process if needed. Insurance doesn't cover personal items in the vehicle."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you pick up from gated communities in Fort Myers?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. We handle gated community pickups daily in Fort Myers. Provide gate codes or visitor access instructions 24 hours before scheduled pickup. Popular communities like Gateway, Fiddlesticks, and Pelican Preserve are all accessible. Island locations (Fort Myers Beach, Sanibel) require bridge access confirmation. Some HOAs restrict commercial trucks during certain hours - we coordinate timing. Drivers call 30 minutes before arrival so you can escort them if needed."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if Chicago weather delays my delivery?",
        "answer": "Winter storms can temporarily halt deliveries near Chicago. Carriers won't drive in unsafe conditions - safety comes first. We notify you immediately if weather causes delays. Your car stays secured on the carrier until roads clear. No extra charges for weather delays. Most delays are 24-48 hours maximum. We provide real-time updates via text and email. Spring and summer shipments avoid this issue entirely. Book enclosed transport for winter shipments to protect from road salt."

Enclosed transport uses covered trailers that protect against rain, snow, and road debris. Choose enclosed for luxury cars, classics, or vehicles with custom paint. Enclosed costs twice as much but offers maximum protection. Most Sarasota to Detroit snowbirds use open transport without issues."

If you can't be present, authorize a friend or family member in writing. They must be 18+ with valid ID. No exceptions for insurance purposes."

      {
        "question": "What about winter weather delays?",
        "answer": "Winter shipping faces potential delays in Kentucky, Ohio, and southern Michigan. Snow and ice slow carriers by 1-2 days. We monitor weather and reroute around major storms when possible. Your car stays safe on the carrier during delays. Carriers don't drive in dangerous conditions. Most winter shipments arrive on time, but budget an extra 2 days during January and February. Spring and summer rarely see weather delays on this route."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will my car have a full tank when delivered?",
        "answer": "Keep your tank at quarter-full or less for pickup. A full tank adds unnecessary weight and creates a fire hazard. Carriers require below half-tank for safety regulations. Your fuel level won't change during transport. The car isn't driven except for loading and unloading. Some customers arrive with an empty tank and we load it anyway. Just don't show up with a completely full tank or drivers will ask you to burn some fuel."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my car insured during transport?",
        "answer": "All licensed carriers provide cargo insurance up to $100,000 minimum per vehicle. Our partner carriers carry $250,000-1,000,000 policies. Insurance covers damage during loading, transport, and unloading. You're protected against carrier negligence, accidents, and weather damage. Document your car's condition with photos before shipping. Report any delivery damage immediately while the driver is present. Your personal auto insurance doesn't cover transport, so carrier insurance is your only protection."

Spring (March-April) sees slight delays due to high demand. Your carrier picks up in Scottsdale and drives straight through with minimal stops."

        "question": "Can I pack personal items in my car?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can pack up to 100 pounds in the trunk. Items must be below window level and secured. Carriers are not liable for personal items. Do not pack valuables, firearms, or hazardous materials. This is an industry-standard policy due to insurance restrictions."

      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between door-to-door and terminal delivery?",
        "answer": "Door-to-door means the carrier picks up at your Scottsdale home. In Chicago, door-to-door works in suburbs like Naperville. Downtown Chicago (Loop, River North) requires terminal meetups. You drive to a parking lot in Schaumburg or Oak Park. This avoids city parking restrictions and saves $75-150."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to be present for pickup and delivery?",
        "answer": "Yes, or you need an authorized agent over 18 with a valid ID. The driver inspects your car and you sign a Bill of Lading. This documents the vehicle condition. The same process happens at Chicago delivery. You cannot leave keys under a mat."

      {
        "question": "How long does it take to ship from Tampa to Cleveland?",
        "answer": "Transit time runs 3-5 days for the 1,150-mile journey. Pickup happens within 1-3 days of booking. Your car travels I-75 North through Georgia, Tennessee, and Kentucky. Weather rarely delays this route except during Ohio winter storms. Most vehicles arrive in 4 days during normal conditions. Summer peak season may add a day due to high volume. We provide GPS tracking so you know exactly where your car is."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I pack personal items in my car?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can pack up to 100 pounds in the trunk only. Items must stay below window level for safety and legal compliance. Carriers don't insure personal belongings, so pack at your own risk. Don't leave valuables, important documents, or fragile items. Remove toll transponders and garage door openers before shipping. The 100-pound limit prevents overloading the carrier. Excess weight can result in your car being refused for loading."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost to ship a car from Tampa to Cleveland?",
        "answer": "Open transport averages $575-750 depending on vehicle size and season. Sedans cost less than trucks or SUVs. Enclosed transport adds $200-300 to protect from weather. Summer pricing runs higher due to demand from college students. Winter offers better rates but potential weather delays. Get an exact quote based on your specific vehicle and dates. Prices include door-to-door service in both cities. No hidden fees for standard residential pickup and delivery."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is door-to-door service available in both Tampa and Cleveland?",
        "answer": "Yes, we offer door-to-door service in both cities for most locations. Tampa metro area pickups work throughout Hillsborough County. Cleveland deliveries reach all neighborhoods including suburbs. Some restrictions apply to extremely narrow streets or gated communities. In those cases, we arrange a nearby meeting point like a shopping center. Downtown Cleveland high-rise residents may use building loading zones. We coordinate exact logistics when you book your shipment."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the best time of year to ship from Tampa to Cleveland?",
        "answer": "Spring and fall offer the best combination of weather and pricing. March through May provides reliable transit with moderate demand. September through November sees good availability before winter weather. Avoid December through February if possible due to Ohio snow. Summer works fine but costs more due to peak relocation season. Book 2-3 weeks ahead during busy months for best rates and scheduling."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to be present for pickup and delivery?",
        "answer": "You or an authorized agent must be present for both pickup and delivery. The driver needs someone to sign the Bill of Lading. This document records your car's condition before and after transport. Take photos of your vehicle before the driver loads it. Inspect your car carefully upon delivery before signing. Your representative must be 18 or older with valid ID. We provide 24-hour notice before both pickup and delivery."

Spring season (March-May) sometimes adds a day due to high carrier demand. Your driver calls 24 hours before both pickup and delivery."

      {
        "question": "Can I pack personal items in my car?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can pack up to 100 pounds in the trunk. Items must stay below window level so drivers can see. Insurance doesn't cover personal belongings, so ship valuables separately. Don't pack food, plants, or anything illegal. Remove toll tags and garage door openers before pickup."

      {
        "question": "How much does it cost?",
        "answer": "Open transport runs $650-$800 for sedans on this route. Enclosed carriers cost $1,200-$1,500 for classic cars or luxury vehicles. Prices jump 15-20% during spring migration season. Your exact quote depends on your pickup and delivery addresses. Get your free quote to see real-time pricing."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to be present for pickup and delivery?",
        "answer": "Yes, you or someone you trust must be there. The driver needs a signature on the Bill of Lading. You'll inspect the car together and note any existing damage. This protects both you and the carrier. The whole process takes 10-15 minutes per location."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if my car doesn't run?",
        "answer": "Non-running vehicles cost $150-$200 extra because carriers need a winch. Your car must roll, steer, and brake for safety. Tell us upfront if it doesn't run. Surprise inoperable cars delay pickup and cost more. We arrange special equipment when you're honest from the start."

        "answer": "Typically 5-7 days for the 1,740-mile journey. This assumes normal weather and no carrier delays. Spring migration season (March-May) can add 1-2 days due to high volume. Carriers drive roughly 500 miles per day and must rest per DOT regulations. If your car ships on a Monday from SF, expect Austin delivery by Saturday or the following Monday."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I pack personal items in my car?",
        "answer": "Yes, but with strict limits. You can pack up to 100 lbs in the trunk only. Nothing on seats or dashboards—it blocks the driver's view during loading. Personal items aren't insured by the carrier, so avoid valuables. Think: clothes, linens, or lightweight boxes. No hazardous materials, firearms, or perishables. Many customers ship a box of SF sourdough—just keep it under 100 lbs total!"
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost?",
        "answer": "Open transport runs $875-$1,025 for sedans, $925-$1,075 for SUVs, and $1,100-$1,300 for large trucks. Enclosed transport nearly doubles those prices. Costs spike in spring (peak moving season) and drop in winter. SF's narrow streets may add $50-$100 for terminal meetups. Always get quotes from 3-4 companies—prices vary by availability."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the best time of year to ship?",
        "answer": "Fall (September-November) offers the best balance of weather, speed, and price. Spring is peak season with 15-20% higher costs. Summer heat slows desert crossings through Arizona. Winter is cheapest but watch for rare ice storms in West Texas. If you're flexible, avoid March through May for best pricing."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to be present for pickup and delivery?",
        "answer": "Yes, or designate someone over 18 with a valid ID. You'll sign the Bill of Lading—a condition report documenting your car's pre-shipment state. Take photos before the driver loads it. At Austin delivery, inspect your car before signing. Check for new scratches or damage. Most deliveries happen between 8am-6pm, but carriers call 24 hours ahead to confirm."

Pickup scheduling affects total time. If the truck is already full, pickup happens within 1-3 days. Empty trucks may take 5-7 days to fill before departing LA."

Carriers are NOT licensed to transport household goods. Your items travel at your own risk. Remove all valuables. Never pack items on seats or dashboard. Insurance does NOT cover personal belongings."

        "question": "Why can't trucks deliver to Manhattan?",

Residential streets are too narrow for 70-foot trucks. Parking restrictions make stops impossible. You'll meet the driver at a terminal in New Jersey or the Bronx instead."

        "answer": "Transit time is typically 2-4 days for the 801-mile journey. Summer shipments average 2-3 days with good weather. Winter can add 1-2 days if I-25 closes due to Colorado snowstorms. Carriers drive 450-500 miles daily, so your car reaches Denver quickly. Book during fall for the fastest, most predictable delivery windows."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I pack personal items in my car?",
        "answer": "Yes, but with limits. You can pack up to 100 pounds in the trunk only. Items must be below window level and not visible. Carriers aren't liable for personal belongings—insurance doesn't cover them. Don't pack valuables, firearms, or perishables. Moving boxes should go with a moving company, not in your shipped car."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost to ship a car from Dallas to Denver?",
        "answer": "Open transport averages $600-$750 for sedans. Enclosed transport runs $950-$1,150 for extra protection. Prices spike 15-20% in summer when demand peaks. Larger vehicles like trucks cost $100-$150 more than sedans. Always compare 3-4 quotes—prices vary by carrier and availability. Booking 2-3 weeks ahead locks in better rates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is door-to-door delivery available in both cities?",
        "answer": "Yes, both Dallas and Denver offer full door-to-door service. Dallas pickups are easy with wide suburban streets. Denver deliveries work smoothly in suburbs like Aurora and Lakewood. Downtown areas in both cities may require meeting at a parking lot. Always confirm your exact address with the dispatcher before booking."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if there's a snowstorm during my shipment?",
        "answer": "Carriers monitor weather closely and may delay pickup 24-48 hours. If I-25 closes near Monument Hill, expect 1-2 day delays. Reputable companies communicate delays immediately via text or email. Your car stays safe on the truck—drivers wait out storms at truck stops. Winter bookings should include flexible delivery windows of 5-7 days."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to be present for pickup and delivery?",
        "answer": "Yes, or an authorized representative over 18. You'll sign the Bill of Lading at pickup documenting car condition. Take photos of all sides before the driver loads it. At delivery, inspect the car carefully before signing. If you can't be there, provide written authorization for someone else. Never sign a blank inspection report."

      {
        "question": "How long does it take to ship from Houston to Denver?",
        "answer": "Transit time is 3-5 days depending on season and carrier schedule. Summer runs take 3 days because trucks run direct routes daily. Winter can stretch to 5 days if I-25 closes for Front Range snowstorms. We pick up within 1-3 days of booking, so total time from quote to delivery is 4-8 days. Expedited service guarantees 3-day delivery for an extra $150-$200."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I pack personal items in my car?",
        "answer": "Yes, but with limits. You can pack up to 100 pounds in the trunk only. Nothing on seats or dashboards because it blocks driver visibility during loading. Items must be below window level. Pack at your own risk - carrier insurance doesn't cover personal belongings. Don't pack valuables, firearms, or perishables. Most shippers use this for clothes, bedding, and non-fragile household items during moves."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost to ship from Houston to Denver?",
        "answer": "Open transport for a sedan runs $650-$850 depending on season. Winter (Dec-Feb) adds 15-20% due to snow risk. Summer peak season (Jun-Aug) adds 10% due to demand. Enclosed transport costs $950-$1,200 and protects from altitude dust. Larger vehicles like trucks and SUVs add $50-$100. Get exact pricing by requesting a quote with your vehicle details and preferred dates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is door-to-door service available in both cities?",
        "answer": "Yes. Houston has excellent truck access to all neighborhoods except some inner-loop gated areas. Denver offers full residential delivery except mountain communities above 8,000 feet. If you live in Evergreen, Conifer, or mountain areas, we deliver to a terminal in Lakewood or Golden. Cherry Creek and Capitol Hill may require street-side pickup if alley access is blocked."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if there's bad weather during my shipment?",
        "answer": "Houston rarely delays shipments except during hurricanes or severe flooding. Denver winter storms cause 1-2 day delays when I-25 closes through Colorado Springs. We monitor weather and notify you immediately if delays occur. Your delivery window expands by 24-48 hours during winter months to account for Front Range conditions. Carriers will not drive in unsafe conditions - safety comes first."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to be present for pickup and delivery?",
        "answer": "Yes, or you can designate someone over 18 with ID. You'll inspect the car with the driver and sign a condition report at both ends. This takes 10-15 minutes. If you cannot be present, a friend or family member can sign on your behalf. They'll need your authorization and must document the vehicle condition with photos."

Once loaded, transit takes 3-4 days in good weather. Winter shipments may take 5-7 days if Michigan faces snow delays. Expedited service guarantees pickup within 24 hours and delivery in 3 days for an additional $200-300 fee."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I pack personal items in my car?",
        "answer": "Yes, but with strict limits. You can place up to 100 pounds in the trunk only. Items must stay below window level so they're not visible. Carriers are not liable for personal items, and insurance doesn't cover them. Never pack valuables, firearms, or flammable items. Most drivers will refuse the load if they see prohibited items during inspection."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost?",
        "answer": "Open transport for a sedan runs $675-$775 depending on season and fuel prices. SUVs and trucks cost $725-$975. Enclosed transport adds $400-600 to protect from weather. Winter pricing (December-February) runs 15-20% higher due to Michigan snow. Book 2-3 weeks ahead in summer for best rates. Last-minute bookings may cost $100-200 more."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to be present for pickup and delivery?",
        "answer": "Yes, you or your representative must be present with ID at both locations. The driver needs your signature on the Bill of Lading and vehicle inspection report. You'll do a walk-around inspection to document existing damage before loading. At delivery, you'll inspect the car again and sign final paperwork. The process takes 15-20 minutes at each end."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if my car breaks down before pickup?",
        "answer": "Non-running vehicles cost $150-$250 extra to ship. The carrier needs advance notice to bring a winch. Your car must roll, steer, and brake even if the engine doesn't start. Completely inoperable vehicles (seized brakes, locked steering) may require flatbed service at higher cost. Disclose mechanical issues when booking to avoid delays on pickup day."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my car insured during transport?",
        "answer": "Yes. All licensed carriers carry cargo insurance covering $100,000-$250,000 per load. This covers damage that occurs during transport only. Pre-existing damage documented at pickup is not covered. Your personal auto insurance remains primary, with carrier insurance as secondary. Request a copy of the carrier's insurance certificate before your car loads."
