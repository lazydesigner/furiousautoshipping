        "answer": "Transit time averages 4-6 days for this 1,280-mile journey. Weather affects timing—winter storms in Virginia or Maryland can add 1-2 days. Summer offers the fastest service at 4 days average. Peak season demand (March-May northbound) sometimes extends delivery to 6 days. We provide GPS tracking so you monitor your car's progress up I-95 in real-time."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I pack personal items in my car?",
        "answer": "Yes, but only in the trunk. Industry standard allows up to 100 lbs of personal items. Items must fit below the window line so they're not visible. Carriers are not licensed to transport household goods, so you pack at your own risk. Do not pack valuables, firearms, or hazardous materials. Our insurance covers the vehicle only, not personal belongings inside."

        "question": "How much does it cost to ship a car from Miami to New York?",

Peak season (March-May) increases rates by 15-25%. Winter off-peak season (December-February) offers the lowest prices. Get an exact quote based on your specific vehicle and dates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will the driver deliver to my apartment building in Manhattan?",
        "answer": "No. Manhattan below 60th Street bans 18-wheelers on most streets. We deliver to accessible terminals in Long Island City (Queens), the South Bronx, or Secaucus, NJ. You drive or Uber to pick up your car. Brooklyn and some Queens neighborhoods also require terminal meets due to narrow residential streets. This protects your car from tight-space damage."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if a hurricane threatens Miami during my pickup window?",
        "answer": "We monitor all weather closely. If a hurricane threatens South Florida, we contact you immediately to reschedule. Safety comes first. Most carriers evacuate the Miami area 48-72 hours before hurricane landfall. We'll pick up your car after the storm passes and roads reopen. No cancellation fees apply for hurricane delays—it's beyond everyone's control."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to be present for pickup and delivery?",
        "answer": "Yes, or an authorized adult over 18. Someone must be present to sign the Bill of Lading and hand over keys. This protects both you and the carrier. The person inspects the car with the driver and notes any existing damage on the condition report. At delivery in New York, you or your representative inspects the car again before signing off."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you ship my car if it doesn't run?",
        "answer": "Yes, but inoperable vehicles cost $150-$200 more. Carriers need a working winch to load non-running cars onto the trailer. The vehicle must roll and steer. If the battery is dead, that's fine. If the transmission is locked or wheels don't turn, special equipment is needed. Always disclose if your car doesn't run when requesting a quote."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I prepare my car for shipping?",
        "answer": "Remove all personal items except up to 100 lbs in the trunk. Disable your car alarm to prevent it from draining the battery. Leave only a quarter tank of gas—full tanks add weight and cost. Remove toll transponders (E-ZPass, SunPass) to avoid charges. Take photos of your car from all angles before pickup. Ensure your car has no leaks and the battery holds a charge."

        "question": "How long does it take to ship from Fort Lauderdale to New York City?",
        "answer": "Transit time runs 4-6 days for the 1,280-mile journey. Pickup happens within 1-3 days of booking during normal seasons. The actual drive takes 19-22 hours but drivers must rest per DOT rules. Spring northbound season adds 1-2 days due to high demand. Winter ice storms near Richmond or DC can delay delivery by a day. Summer offers the fastest transit with clear roads and long daylight hours."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I pack personal items in my car?",
        "answer": "Yes, but it's risky. Most carriers allow up to 100 pounds in the trunk only. Nothing on seats or visible through windows. Items must not exceed the roofline. Insurance does not cover personal belongings - only the vehicle. If items shift and damage your car during transport, you're liable. We recommend shipping important items separately via UPS or bringing them in your luggage."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost to ship from Fort Lauderdale to NYC?",
        "answer": "Open transport runs $600-750 for sedans and small SUVs. Large trucks cost $750-850. Enclosed trailers add $300-400 for total costs of $950-1,150. Spring northbound season (April-May) adds 15-20% to base prices due to snowbird demand. Manhattan terminal delivery adds no extra fees. Door-to-door in outer boroughs may add $50-100 for tight street navigation. Get an exact quote based on your vehicle and dates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you deliver directly to Manhattan addresses?",
        "answer": "No, not below 60th Street. NYC bans commercial trucks in most of Manhattan. We deliver to secure terminal lots in Secaucus, NJ or Long Island City, Queens. You drive 15-20 minutes to pick up your car. This is industry standard - any company promising Manhattan door-to-door delivery is likely using a small truck and charging premium fees. Our terminal delivery is free and convenient."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the best time of year to ship this route?",
        "answer": "Summer (June-August) offers fast transit and moderate prices. Fall (September-November) has balanced traffic and fair rates. Avoid spring (April-May) when snowbirds return north - prices spike 20% and booking takes 2-3 weeks. Winter works if you dodge ice storms but southbound traffic to Florida drives up northbound costs. Book summer or fall for best value and speed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my car insured during transport?",
        "answer": "Yes. All licensed carriers must carry cargo insurance covering your vehicle in transit. Our carriers provide $100,000-250,000 minimum coverage per load. Insurance covers collision damage, not personal items inside. You'll receive the carrier's insurance certificate before pickup showing active coverage. Document existing scratches with photos before the driver loads your car. Review the condition report together at pickup and delivery."

        "question": "How long does it take to ship from Boca Raton to Long Island?",
        "answer": "The trip takes 4-6 days under normal conditions. Your car travels 1,280 miles up I-95 through eight states. Spring and summer offer faster transit with good weather. Winter can add 1-2 days if ice storms hit Virginia or Maryland. Peak season (March-April) may extend pickup times by a few days due to high demand. We'll give you a pickup window and keep you updated during transport."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I pack personal items in my car?",
        "answer": "Yes, but with strict limits. You can pack up to 100 pounds in the trunk only. Nothing on seats or dashboards. Insurance doesn't cover personal items, so pack at your own risk. Don't put valuables, cash, or important documents in the car. Most drivers are fine with a trunk full of clothes or linens. Anything over 100 pounds can cause DOT weight violations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost to ship from Boca Raton to Long Island?",
        "answer": "Open transport runs $750-$950 for a standard sedan. Small SUVs cost $800-$900. Large trucks or vans run $900-$1,050. Enclosed transport adds 40-60% to these prices. Spring (March-May) is most expensive due to Snowbird demand. Winter offers the best deals. Your exact Long Island location matters too. Hamptons delivery costs more than Levittown due to access challenges."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is door-to-door service available on Long Island?",
        "answer": "It depends on your street. Most suburban Nassau and Suffolk towns allow full door-to-door service. Tight village streets or beach communities may require a terminal meet nearby. The driver will scout your address and call ahead. If the truck can't fit, we'll arrange to meet you at a shopping center or parking lot within a few miles. This avoids residential access fees and keeps your price lower."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if there's a hurricane during my shipment?",
        "answer": "We monitor weather closely during hurricane season (June-November). If a storm threatens the I-95 corridor, we'll reroute carriers inland through I-77 or I-81. This may add 1-2 days to transit but keeps your car safe. We'll notify you immediately of any weather delays. In extreme cases, we may delay pickup until the storm passes. Your car's safety is our top priority."

        "answer": "Typical transit time is 4-6 days for the 1,290-mile journey. Your car leaves Tampa on I-75 North and arrives via I-93 or I-90 into Boston. Summer shipments run faster (4-5 days) because of good weather and driver availability. Winter adds 1-2 days because of weather delays through Virginia and the Mid-Atlantic. Spring and fall are middle ground at 5 days average. We give you a pickup window (usually 1-5 days) and a delivery window once your car is loaded. Track your shipment in real-time through our system."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I pack personal items in my car?",
        "answer": "Yes, but with limits. You can put up to 100 pounds of personal items in the trunk only. Nothing on the seats or dashboard. Insurance doesn't cover personal items, so you ship them at your own risk. Don't pack valuables, electronics, or fragile items. Carriers inspect cars before loading and will refuse overloaded vehicles. Pack smart: clothes, linens, and non-fragile items work fine. Heavy items can damage your suspension during transport."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost?",
        "answer": "Open transport from Tampa to Boston runs $700-$850 for a standard sedan. Small SUVs cost $750-$850. Large trucks or lifted vehicles run $850-$950. Enclosed transport adds $400-$600 to these prices. Winter and spring see 15-25% higher prices because of snowbird demand. Gated community pickups may add $50-$75. Final price depends on your exact vehicle, pickup location, delivery location, and time of year. Get a free quote for your specific situation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is door-to-door service available in both cities?",
        "answer": "Tampa door-to-door works great in suburbs like Brandon, Carrollwood, and New Tampa. Downtown Tampa and historic areas require terminal meets. Boston is trickier because of narrow streets. Beacon Hill, North End, and Back Bay need terminal delivery at nearby lots. South Boston, Dorchester, and outlying areas can do door-to-door depending on your exact street. We assess your addresses during booking and tell you exactly what's possible."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about insurance coverage?",
        "answer": "All carriers have cargo insurance covering your vehicle during transport. Basic coverage is included in your price and covers major damage. You can buy additional coverage for high-value or luxury vehicles. Your personal auto insurance stays active during transport. Document your car's condition with photos before pickup. Our drivers do the same. Any damage is reported immediately and claims are filed within 24 hours."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to be present for pickup and delivery?",
        "answer": "Yes, you or someone you authorize must be present at both ends. At pickup, you'll sign the Bill of Lading and do a vehicle inspection with the driver. At delivery, you'll inspect the car again and sign off. Your representative needs to be 18+ with valid ID. If you can't be there, give us the contact info for your representative. They'll need to do the same inspection and signing process."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you ship my car if it doesn't run?",
        "answer": "Yes, but it costs more. Non-running vehicles require special equipment (winches) to load and unload. This adds $150-$200 to your quote. Your car needs to roll, steer, and brake even if the engine doesn't start. Totally immobile vehicles need flatbed transport, which costs significantly more. Tell us during booking if your car doesn't run so we can arrange the right equipment."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if there's a hurricane in Florida during my pickup window?",
        "answer": "We monitor weather constantly. If a hurricane threatens Tampa during your pickup window, we'll contact you immediately. Options include: moving your pickup date earlier, delaying until after the storm, or switching to a terminal location away from the danger zone. Your safety and your car's safety come first. We don't charge cancellation fees for weather emergencies. Florida hurricane season (June-November) requires flexibility."

        "answer": "Transit time ranges from 4-6 days depending on season and weather. The 1,340-mile route uses I-75 and I-95. Spring and fall peak seasons may extend to 7-8 days due to high demand. Winter ice storms in Virginia can add 1-2 days. Summer offers the fastest service with minimal delays."

      {
        "question": "Can I pack personal items in my car?",
        "answer": "Yes, but keep it under 100 pounds in the trunk only. Items must not be visible through windows. We are not liable for personal belongings. Do not pack valuables, firearms, or perishables. Insurance covers the vehicle only, not contents."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost?",
        "answer": "Open transport for a sedan costs $750-$850. Enclosed transport runs $1,350-$1,550. SUVs and trucks cost $50-100 more. Peak season (April and October) adds 15-20%. Greenwich residential delivery fees add $150-200 if you want door-to-door service on narrow streets."

You drive your car home the final mile. Door-to-door is possible with a smaller truck for an extra $150-200 fee."

        "question": "What about gated communities in Naples?",

      {
        "question": "Is my car insured during transport?",
        "answer": "Yes. All carriers have $1 million cargo insurance. This covers damage during loading, transit, and unloading. You must inspect your car at delivery and note any damage on the Bill of Lading immediately. Take photos before pickup as proof of condition."

      {
        "question": "How long does it take to ship from Fort Myers to Chicago?",
        "answer": "Transit time is typically 3-5 days for this 1,350-mile route. Your car isn't driving non-stop - drivers follow federal hours-of-service regulations requiring rest breaks. Pickup happens within 1-3 days of booking during normal season. Add 1-2 extra days during peak snowbird months (October-November southbound, April-May northbound). Winter weather near Chicago can add unexpected delays. We provide GPS tracking so you know exactly where your car is during transport."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I pack personal items in my car?",
        "answer": "Yes, but with strict limits. You can pack up to 100 pounds in the trunk only. Nothing on seats, dashboard, or visible through windows. Insurance doesn't cover personal items - pack at your own risk. Carriers inspect and may refuse overloaded vehicles. Don't pack valuables, firearms, or perishables. Moving boxes work better for household items. This rule applies industry-wide due to weight regulations and liability concerns."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost to ship from Fort Myers to Chicago?",
        "answer": "Open transport averages $625-$775 depending on vehicle size and season. Enclosed transport runs $950-$1,200 for weather protection. Prices jump 20-30% during peak snowbird season (October-November and April-May). Chicago downtown delivery adds $75-150 versus suburban terminal pickup. Larger trucks and SUVs cost more due to carrier weight limits. Get an exact quote based on your specific dates and vehicle type. Prices include full insurance coverage during transit."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the best time of year to ship this route?",
        "answer": "Summer (June-August) offers the best combination of low prices and fast transit times. Weather is clear and demand drops after snowbird season ends. Avoid October-November (southbound rush) and April-May (northbound rush) if you want cheaper rates. Winter shipments face delays from ice and snow near Chicago. Spring and fall have moderate pricing but require 2-3 weeks advance booking. Holiday weeks (Thanksgiving, Christmas) see price spikes and limited availability."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you deliver to downtown Chicago or just suburbs?",
        "answer": "We deliver throughout the Chicago metro area but downtown Loop requires special arrangements. Large car carriers cannot navigate narrow city streets or residential zones with permit restrictions. Downtown customers meet drivers at nearby suburban terminals in Cicero, Berwyn, or Des Plaines. Suburban addresses (Naperville, Aurora, Schaumburg) get direct door-to-door delivery. We confirm exact pickup/delivery logistics when you book. No extra fee for terminal meetings - it's included in your quote."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my car insured during transport?",
        "answer": "Yes. All licensed carriers must carry $1,000,000 cargo insurance minimum. This covers damage during loading, transit, and unloading. You receive the carrier's insurance certificate before pickup. Document your car's condition with photos before shipping. Inspect carefully at delivery and note any damage on the Bill of Lading immediately. File claims within 48 hours. Our team helps you through the claims process if needed. Insurance doesn't cover personal items in the vehicle."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you pick up from gated communities in Fort Myers?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. We handle gated community pickups daily in Fort Myers. Provide gate codes or visitor access instructions 24 hours before scheduled pickup. Popular communities like Gateway, Fiddlesticks, and Pelican Preserve are all accessible. Island locations (Fort Myers Beach, Sanibel) require bridge access confirmation. Some HOAs restrict commercial trucks during certain hours - we coordinate timing. Drivers call 30 minutes before arrival so you can escort them if needed."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if Chicago weather delays my delivery?",
        "answer": "Winter storms can temporarily halt deliveries near Chicago. Carriers won't drive in unsafe conditions - safety comes first. We notify you immediately if weather causes delays. Your car stays secured on the carrier until roads clear. No extra charges for weather delays. Most delays are 24-48 hours maximum. We provide real-time updates via text and email. Spring and summer shipments avoid this issue entirely. Book enclosed transport for winter shipments to protect from road salt."
