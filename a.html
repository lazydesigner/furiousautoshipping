            answer: "We prioritize speed for dealers; most regional auction lanes (under 500 miles) are completed within 24 to 48 hours of dispatch. For cross-country moves, we typically average 3–5 days. We understand that \"days to lot\" affects your holding costs, so we pre-stage carriers at major hubs like Manheim and Adesa to ensure your vehicles move as soon as the gate pass is released."
